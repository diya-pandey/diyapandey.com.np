## Hey- 
This is Diya, another boring human on this pale blue dot:-)

Diya is a keen physics and tech enthusiast. She loves to dive deep into the vastness of cosmos and want to explore more about it through quantum computing. She belives everyone should get equiatble opportunities and works to make it true. 

Feel free to connect with her. Also don't just say hello. Talk about physics, books, politics, life and of course how can we get more Women in STEM.
