As a month-long project, my high school team worked to find a new solution for the precise detection of atrial fibrillation. Among 30+ projects from 10+ countries, we stood as the winner in the Biology/Chemistry category. At the end of the project, I learned to use Latex, organize the ideas, and present them in a research paper.
