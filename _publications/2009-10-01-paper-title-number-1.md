title: "An Approach For Detection Of Atrial Fibrillation Using Quantum Sensor In Magnetic Induction Tomography (MIT)"
collection: Competitions
permalink: https://ypstem.wixsite.com/stemexplorerscontest/projects-3
excerpt: 'Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac rhythm disorder characterized by rapid and irregular beating of the atrial chambers of the heart.The prevalence of AF is expected to double in next decades creating the threat for global medical challenge. Causing more deaths in developed countries rather than developing countries, the timely detection of AF is still not achieved due to the lack of precise diagnostic and guiding tools, questioning the scientific and technological society of the 21st century.Therefore, we identify a promising novel solution of Quantum Sensor in MIT as precise diagnostic tool for the detection of Atrial Fibrillation. A quantum sensor
is applied in the system as an excitation detection agent which is designed mainly for biomedical applications.The feasibility of this method makes it a promising tool also for application for other areas such as neurology and oncology.'
